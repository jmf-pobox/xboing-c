{"id":"xboing-97c","title":"Fix TrueColor rendering: use gccopy for text and lines","description":"Changed DrawLine() and DrawText() in misc.c from triple-draw XOR/AND/XOR pattern (designed for PseudoColor) to single gccopy draw. Fixed white/black color init in init.c to use WhitePixel/BlackPixel instead of colormap lookup. Fixed sleepSync in main.c to only delay during gameplay modes (MODE_GAME/MODE_BALL_WAIT), other modes use XSync without delay for responsive animations. Uncommitted working changes.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jmf@pobox.com","created_at":"2026-02-20T06:31:37.373642547-08:00","created_by":"J F","updated_at":"2026-02-20T06:32:17.321526964-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-20T06:32:17.321526964-08:00","close_reason":"Committed as cb40810","labels":["bugfix"]}
