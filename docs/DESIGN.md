# Design Decisions

This file records architectural decisions for the XBoing modernization using
the lightweight [Nygard ADR format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## ADR-001: Use CMake as the sole build system

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
MODERNIZATION.md listed "Meson (or CMake)" as the target build system. Both are
capable of managing the SDL2 migration. However, the project already has a mature
CMake setup: a 154-line root `CMakeLists.txt`, a 134-line `tests/CMakeLists.txt`,
`CMakePresets.json` for Debug and ASan configurations, and a CI workflow that
exercises both presets. No Meson infrastructure exists.

Introducing Meson would mean maintaining two build systems in parallel during the
transition, doubling the surface area for CI and contributor onboarding. The
project has a single maintainer and a single platform target (Linux); the
polyglot flexibility of Meson offers no practical advantage here.

**Decision:**
CMake is the build system for the entire modernization. We will not introduce
Meson. SDL2 dependency discovery, backend switching, and all future build
infrastructure will be implemented in CMake.

**Consequences:**

- Contributors only need to learn one build system.
- Existing CI, presets, and test infrastructure carry forward unchanged.
- If a future need arises that CMake cannot satisfy, this decision can be
  revisited — but the burden of proof is on the alternative.

## ADR-002: XDG Base Directory path resolution

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The game resolves file paths via compile-time `#define`s (`HIGH_SCORE_FILE`,
`LEVEL_INSTALL_DIR`, `SOUNDS_DIR`) with optional `getenv()` overrides
(`XBOING_SCORE_FILE`, `XBOING_LEVELS_DIR`, `XBOING_SOUND_DIR`). This pattern is
duplicated across 12+ callsites in 7 files. Save and score files go to `$HOME`
as dotfiles (`.xboing-scores`, `.xboing.scr`).

MODERNIZATION.md calls for XDG Base Directory compliance at runtime. The XDG
spec defines standard locations for user data (`$XDG_DATA_HOME`, defaulting to
`$HOME/.local/share`) and system data (`$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, defaulting to
`/usr/local/share:/usr/share`).

**Decision:**
Introduce a `paths` module (`src/paths.c`, `include/paths.h`) that centralizes
all file path resolution. The module is pure C with no X11 or SDL2 dependency.

Resolution priority for read-only assets (levels, sounds):

1. Legacy env var (`XBOING_LEVELS_DIR` / `XBOING_SOUND_DIR`) — backward compat
2. `XDG_DATA_DIRS` search — each dir + `/xboing/levels/<file>`, first match
3. `XDG_DATA_HOME` — `$HOME/.local/share/xboing/levels/<file>`
4. CWD fallback — `./levels/<file>` (development mode)

Resolution priority for writable state (scores, saves):

1. Legacy env var (`XBOING_SCORE_FILE` — global scores only)
2. Existing legacy file on disk — `$HOME/.xboing-scores` etc. (migration compat)
3. XDG default — `$XDG_DATA_HOME/xboing/scores.dat` etc. (fresh installs)

Design constraints:

- Caller-provided buffers (no malloc, no static buffers).
- `paths_init_explicit()` accepts injected env values for deterministic testing.
- The module is introduced and tested in isolation. Wiring into legacy callsites
  is a separate follow-up to keep commits focused and reviewable.

**Consequences:**

- All path logic lives in one place instead of 12+ scattered callsites.
- Legacy env vars continue to work — no user-visible behavior change.
- XDG-compliant locations are available for packaged installs.
- `paths_init_explicit()` makes the module fully testable without `setenv()`.
- Wiring requires touching 7 legacy files; deferring that to a separate PR
  limits blast radius and keeps this change reviewable.
